              How do you protect student information?
            </h3>
            <p>
              We maintain strict security protocols for all student records.
              Access is limited to authorized staff members only, and all
              electronic records are protected with encryption and secure
              password policies. Physical records are kept in locked cabinets
              with restricted access.

              Do you share student photos on social media?
            </h3>
            <p>
              We only share student photos with explicit parental consent.
              During enrollment, parents/guardians are asked to complete a media
              release form indicating their preferences regarding the use of
              their child's image in school publications, website, and social
              media.

              How long do you keep student records?

            <p>
              We retain student records in accordance with educational
              regulations and data protection laws. Academic records are
              typically kept for 7 years after a student leaves the school.
              Basic enrollment information may be kept permanently as part of
              our historical archives.
